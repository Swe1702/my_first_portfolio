# my_first_portfolio
    My task is to create a porfolio based on the given model and add media queries for different screen displays. I have done the task by adding HTML and CSS in following ways

    HTML:
    1. I changed title names and added div tags for header tags.
    2. I added figure,img,alt,p,a tags for adding images nad writting content.
    3. I linked nav elements to the specified section.
    4. I linked my last module project to img 1. When you click on it my project will open in new page.
    5. I added footer and linked my github and linkedin accounts.

    CSS:
    1. I added css properties for each and every class by stating their types with "." and also add css for tags.
    2. I added width and heigts foe the images.
    3. I added css for the display widths between 1200-900px and 900-600px.
    4. Changed sizes of image,text and containers and aligned them based on their display widths.
    5. Added hover effect for all the 5 images in work container.


I did not do it exactly in the same way as the given model but did the same way based on the criteria given and tried my level best to solve it.
